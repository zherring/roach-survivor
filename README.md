# $ROACH Prototype (Local Multiplayer)

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open the game in two or more windows (incognito works great):
   - http://localhost:3000

Each browser session spawns a roach that is shared over WebSockets so you can test multi-client movement and stomps locally.
